### What does "CaptureTheFrog" mean?

It might suprise you to hear that it has nothing to do with frog wrangling. It's actually a two-part pun.<sup>*</sup>

1. I needed a unique username for competing in [Capture the Flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)) competitions.
2. At the same time,  I was building a train simulator for a games engineering coursework at university. This involved collecting (or "capturing") a lot of reference material of specific railway systems to model, and [a "frog" is a component used in a set of railway points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad_switch#Crossing_(frog_or_common_crossing)).
