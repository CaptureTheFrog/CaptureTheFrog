### What does "CaptureTheFrog" mean?

It's a two-part pun.*

1. I needed a unique username for competing in [Capture the Flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)) competitions.
2. At the same time,  I was building a train simulator for a games engineering coursework at university. This involved collecting a lot of reference material of specific railway systems to model, and [a "frog" is a component used in a set of railway points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad_switch#Crossing_(frog_or_common_crossing)).

<sup>*I never said it was funny.</sup>
